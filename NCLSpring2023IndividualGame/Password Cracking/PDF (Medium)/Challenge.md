## Excerpts from Methodologies and techhniques used from NCL Discord
`so i got the hash with pdf2john but then got stuck`
`get the hash, then make sure you check which pdf version it is because there are several options for hashcat and make sure you've updated hashcat in the last couple years probably (or use john)`
`The mode was 10700 I think, it was the newer of the two it guesses for the hash`
