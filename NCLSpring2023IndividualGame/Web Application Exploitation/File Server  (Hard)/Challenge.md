## Excerpts from Methodologies and techhniques used from NCL Discord
`I didnt get final flag, but if you notice the x-commit-hash you could get the hint that there's a /.git folder, and could download the different files in it`
`Then yeah, git-dumper gives server source file which reveals that there's an owners.json file`
`You can access /.git/HEAD or /.git/*`
```
This is a race condition challenge, when you upload a file that already exists, a .bak file will be created. Once the upload is finished, that .bak file is deleted. You need to download the .bak before the upload is finished.

`Standard browser plugins for web pen testing It'll flag repo`
`How do you end up finding out that there even was a .git folder exposed? : X-Commit-Hash header in every request`
`If you run whatweb against the target there is a strange header called x-commit-hash that hints at the fact that there is a git repo.`
`I used curl and bash. You just upload the file and fork, then hammer curl to get the file. Also the .git repo and analyzing the code made it clear.`
