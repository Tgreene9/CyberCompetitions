## Excerpts from Methodologies and techhniques used from NCL Discord
`Simple; enter localhost as the target.`
`This was meant to be a JSON duplicate key attack. In /static/app.js you could see that it's unescaping quotes in JSON that you send`
`So you were meant to send somefakedomain", "hostname":"localhost`
`Yeah, so the idea was that the server checks the first hostname before JSON parsing the data. Then the JSON parse happens, and your duplicate hostname takes over`
